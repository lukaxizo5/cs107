# CS107 – Programming Paradigms (C++ / C / Assembly / Scheme / Python)

This repository contains my coursework and bonus project for Stanford's **CS107 – Programming Paradigms**.  
The course focused on low-level memory management, data structures, abstractions, functional programming, and exposure to multiple programming languages and paradigms.

All assignments were graded with **automated tests** provided by the course staff.
Each assignment folder contains its own README with detailed run instructions (written in Georgian, as they were originally submitted for grading).

## Course Topics Covered

- C++ fundamentals and memory management
- Byte-level data access and validation
- Generic data structures and abstractions
- RISC-V Assembly
- Multithreading with `pthreads`
- Functional Programming (Scheme)
- Python scripting and data processing

---

## Assignments Overview

### Assignment 1 – Random Sentence Generator (C++)
Introductory project focused on basic C++ syntax, file reading, and simple text generation logic.

### Assignment 2 – Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon
Implemented relationship discovery between actors and movies using:
- Byte-level file parsing
- Data validation
- Graph traversal with **Breadth-First Search**

### Assignment 3 – Vector and Hashset
Built reusable, template-based abstractions:
- Generic `Vector`
- Generic `HashSet` implemented using the custom vector

### Assignment 4 – RSS News Feed Aggregation
Developed a search tool that parses RSS feeds and performs keyword lookups across articles.

### Assignments 5 & 6 – (Course Content)
No formal submissions, but core topics included:
- **RISC-V Assembly**
- **Multithreading with pthreads**

### Assignment 7 – Functional Programming (Scheme)
Mini-project written in Scheme emphasizing recursion, immutability, and higher-order functions.

### Assignment 8 – DNA Processing (Python)
Python-based problem solving focused on string/data manipulation and algorithmic reasoning.

## Bonus Project – RISC-V Emulator (C++)

A custom RISC-V emulator written in C++ with:

- Limited instruction set support
- Manual memory/register handling
- Custom test suite written by me
- Focus on instruction decoding and execution flow

---

## Notes

- Each assignment directory includes its own README and run instructions.
- Automated tests were used for official grading.
- The bonus project is fully standalone and self-tested.

This repository represents a comprehensive snapshot of my work in low-level systems programming, abstraction design, and multi-paradigm development.
